### Character : Horvir

#### Backstory
**Origin**:
Horvir's tale is one of resilience and the search for belonging in a world that seems larger than life itself. A fall into a mountain chasm brought him into the care of a family of stone giants, who nurtured him within the depths of their underground home.

**Family and Early Life**:
Born not of giants but raised among them, Horvir's early days were a testament to the unexpected turns fate can take. Despite their love and care, Horvir always felt like an outsider among these towering beings, a pebble in a world of boulders. However, a magical blessing from the earth caused him to grow to an astonishing size, defying the norms of his own kind. With this newfound strength, he learned to wield the might of giants, embodying their power in his every move. Yet, the longing for his true origins never waned. As he reached adulthood, the call to adventure beckoned him forth, driving him to seek his place in a world beyond the mountains that sheltered him. Armed with a stone of good luck as his only keepsake from his home, Horvir set out, determined to make his mark and, perhaps, to find the family he lost so long ago. Every step of his journey is fueled by a fierce determination, a spiteful defiance against the odds stacked against him. Despite his stature compared to his giant kin, Horvir refuses to be overshadowed.

**Motivation**:
After traveling and adventuring for some time, Horvir is approached by an odd person in a tavern. This person, a Vistani, is very interested in Horvir's adventure tales. After showing Horvir a very important letter, the Vistani leaves it on the table. Following a few more drinks, another person storms into the tavern, attacks the Vistani, and steals the letter. The wounded Vistani begs Horvir to chase the attacker and retrieve the letter. Unaware that this is a setup, Horvir chases the attacker, who runs into a thick mist and soon vanishes. Lost in the mist, Horvir loses orientation and consciousness. Upon waking, he finds himself on an unfamiliar road in Barovia.
